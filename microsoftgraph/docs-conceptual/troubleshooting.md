# Troubleshooting the Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module

This article explains how to determine, diagnose, and fix issues that you might encounter when using Microsoft Graph PowerShell.

Before troubleshooting any errors, always ensure that you are running the most recent version of the SDK. To the SDK version you are running, run:

```powershell
Get-InstalledModule
```

The version of the `Microsoft.Graph` module should be the most recent compared to the latest release in the [PowerShell gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph). If your installed module is not upto date, update your module by running:

```PowerShell
Update-Module Microsoft.Graph
```
