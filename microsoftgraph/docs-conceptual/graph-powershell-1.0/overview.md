# Overview
The Microsoft Graph is a unified endpoint for accessing data, intelligence and insights in Microsoft 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security. It exposes REST APis and client libraries to access data.
The Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK acts as an API wrapper for the Microsoft Graph APIs, exposing the entire API set for use in PowerShell. It is a set of cmdlets that helps in managing your identity needs at scale from automating tasks through scripts to managing users in bulk through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
It will help administer every Azure AD feature that has an API in Microsoft Graph.
